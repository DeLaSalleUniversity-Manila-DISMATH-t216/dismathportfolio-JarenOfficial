## WEEK 1:

- We introduced each other by telling our names, course, and favorite hobbies. 
- At first, I don't have any idea what Discrete Mathematics is about. 
- However, our professor discussed a brief introduction about it and it made me interested because it will enhance my critical thinking.
- I have learned that there are different classifications of truth: authoritative, legal, scientific, probable, philosophical, and mathematical. 
- I have learned that the primary focus of Discrete Mathematics is "mathematical" truth.
- I learned the definition of logic which is the <i>basis of all mathematical reasoning, and of all automated reasoning</i> (Rosen, 2007).
- I learned about propositions, a declarative statement that is either true or false but not both, and its definitions - negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, conditional, and biconditional. 
- I learned to use the truth table to prove logical statements. 
- I am introduced to new symbols for logic; ¬ (negation), ∧ (conjunction or "AND"), ∨ (disjunction or "OR"), ⊕ (exclusive or),  → (conditional or implication), and ↔ (biconditional). 
- In addition, we were introduced to the concepts of converse, inverse, and contrapositive. 
- Converse (p → q ≠ q → p), Inverse (¬p → ¬q), Contrapositive (¬q → ¬p).

## WEEK 2:

- I learned that using truth table has its limitations and there is another way to prove logical statements by the use of logical equivalences.
- There are different logical equivalences:

  | Equivalence | Name |
  | :---------: | :--: |
  | p ∧ <b>T</b> ≡ p <p>p ∨ <b>F</b> ≡ p</p> | Identity Laws |
  | p ∨ <b>T</b> ≡ <b>T</b> <p>p ∧ <b>F</b> ≡ <b>F</b> | Domination Laws |
  | p ∨ p ≡ p <p>p ∧ p ≡ p | Idempotent Laws |
  | ¬(¬p) ≡ p | Double Negation Law |
  | p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p <p>p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p</p> | Commutative Laws |
  | (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ q ∨ (p ∨ r) <p>(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ q ∧ (p ∧ r)</p> | Associative Laws |
  | p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (q ∨ r) <p> p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (q ∧ r)</p> | Distributive Laws |
  | ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q <p>¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q</p> | De Morgan's Law |
  | p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p <p>p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p</p> | Absorption Laws |
  | p ∨ ¬p ≡ <b>T</b> <p>p ∧ ¬p ≡ <b>F</b> | Negation Laws |

- After logical equivalances, we learned about Predicate Logic and Quantifiers.
- Predicate Logic deals with propositions that contains predicates, which refers to the <i>property of the subject or statement can have</i> (Rosen, 2007). 
- I learned that quantification is a process of producing a proposition from a propositional function. 
- We are introducted to two quantifiers: " <i><b>For all</i></b> " (∀) Universal Quantification & " <i><b>There exists</i></b> " (∃) Existential Quantification.
- It is funny how our professor correlate the concept of quantification to how politicians say their platforms in elections because it made me critical to hear what platforms would electoral candidates establish and sell to the people this coming elections. 
- We are given a homework to prove if Superman really exists by using the rule of inference.
- I learned that the rule of inference states that an argument is <b>valid</b> if it follows the pattern of the rules of inference.
- I also learned that <i>validity</i> and <i>truth</i> are two different things because an argument can be valid but not true. 
- The rules of inference are <b> Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Conjunction, and Resolution </b>.

## WEEK 3

- The Methods of Prood are introduced to us and as follows: <b>Direct Proof</b>, <b>Proof by Contraposition</b>, <b>Vacuuos Proof</b>, <b>Trivial Proof</b>, <b>Proof by Contradiction</b>, <b>Proof by Equivalence</b>, and <b>Mathematical Induction</b>.
- Direct Proof: <p>- Assume the p is true </p><p>-Then show that q is true</p>
- Proof by Contraposition: <p>- Assume the ¬q is true </p><p>-Then show that ¬p is true</p>
- Vacuuos Proof: <p>- Show that p is false </p><p>-Then p → q is true</p>
- Trivial Proof:  <p>- Show that q is true </p><p>-Then p → q is true</p>
- Proof of contradiction is slightly introduced.

## WEEK 4

- Proof of Contradiction: <p>- Show that ¬P is true (P is the whole statement) </p><p>-Then show that it will end up in a contradiction</p>
- Proof by equivalence: <p>- Show that p ↔ q  is true </p><p>-Then show that q ↔ p  is also true </p>
- Mathematical Induction: <p>- Use the basis step: substitute any element to P(k) </p><p>-Then use the inductive step: this is like direct proof in which you prove that P(k) is true and P(k+1) is true </p>
- Recursive and Summation

## WEEK 5

- Set Theories
- Set Builder Notation
- Set Membership
- Subsets & Power Sets
